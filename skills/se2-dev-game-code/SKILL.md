# SE2 Game Code Search Skill

Allows reading the decompiled C# code of Space Engineers 2.

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Commands run in a UNIX shell (busybox), NOT Windows CMD. Use bash syntax!**

Examples:
- ✅ `test -f file.txt && echo exists`
- ✅ `ls -la | head -10`
- ❌ `if exist file.txt (echo exists)` - This will NOT work

**Actions:**

- **prepare**: Run the one-time preparation (Prepare.bat)
- **bash**: Run UNIX shell commands via busybox
- **search**: Run code searches using `search_game_code.py`
- **test**: Test this skill by running `test_search_game_code.bat`

## Routing Decision

Check these patterns **in order** - first match wins:

| Priority | Pattern | Example | Route |
|----------|---------|---------|-------|
| 1 | Empty or bare invocation | `se2-dev-game-code` | Show this help |
| 2 | Prepare keywords | `se2-dev-game-code prepare`, `se2-dev-game-code setup`, `se2-dev-game-code init` | prepare |
| 3 | Bash/shell keywords | `se2-dev-game-code bash`, `se2-dev-game-code grep`, `se2-dev-game-code cat` | bash |
| 4 | Search keywords | `se2-dev-game-code search`, `se2-dev-game-code find class`, `se2-dev-game-code lookup` | search |
| 5 | Test keywords | `se2-dev-game-code test`, `se2-dev-game-code verify`, `se2-dev-game-code check` | test |

## Requirements

The host system must have the following on `PATH`:

- **Python** 3.13 or newer
- **git** command line client (used to version each decompiled game build)
- **dotnet** SDK (for installing `ilspycmd`)

## Getting Started

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Before running ANY commands, read [CommandExecution.md](CommandExecution.md) to avoid common mistakes that cause command failures.**

If the `Prepare.DONE` file is missing in this folder, you MUST run the one-time preparation steps first. See the [prepare action](./actions/prepare.md).

## Folder Layout

After preparation the skill folder contains a `Data` junction. The actual data lives outside the skill folder so that it is preserved across `Clean.bat` / `Prepare.bat` cycles.

```
skills/se2-dev-game-code/
├── Data/                 (junction → %USERPROFILE%\.se2-dev-game-code)
│   ├── .git/             local Git repository tracking decompiled sources
│   ├── .gitignore        ignores CodeIndex/, Content/, __pycache__, *.py[cod], *.bak, *.log
│   ├── game_version.txt  recorded SE2 version label
│   ├── Decompiled/       decompiled C# sources, organised per assembly (committed)
│   ├── Content/          textual game content (NOT committed - regenerated)
│   └── CodeIndex/        CSV indexes (NOT committed - regenerated)
├── Game2/                (junction → game's Game2, removed after preparation)
└── ...                   skill scripts and documentation
```

The `Data` folder is a junction to `%USERPROFILE%\.se2-dev-game-code\`. (`%USERPROFILE%` is used rather than `%LOCALAPPDATA%` so the data sits outside any per-app UWP filesystem virtualization.) Treat `Data/Decompiled`, `Data/Content` and `Data/CodeIndex` exactly as before.

## Local Versioning of Decompiled Sources

The `Data` folder is a local Git repository. Every successful preparation creates a commit of the decompiled C# sources whose message is the game's version label.

This means:

- **All previously decompiled game versions are preserved** in the local Git history. You can `git checkout` any past commit inside `Data/` to inspect or diff against an older build.
- **Game updates are detected automatically** by comparing the binaries' embedded version with `Data/game_version.txt`. If they differ (or the file is missing), `Decompiled/`, `Content/` and `CodeIndex/` are wiped and a fresh decompilation runs.
- This makes it easy to **update plugins for compatibility with new game releases**: diff the relevant source between two commits inside `Data/` to see exactly what changed.

The repository uses an internal author/email (`se2-dev-skills@localhost`) so commits work even on machines without a configured global Git identity.

## Essential Documentation

- **[CommandExecution.md](CommandExecution.md)** - ⚠️ **READ THIS FIRST** - How to run commands correctly on Windows

## Code Search Documentation

- **[QuickStart.md](QuickStart.md)** - More examples and quick reference
- **[CodeSearch.md](CodeSearch.md)** - Complete guide to searching classes, methods, fields, etc.
- **[HierarchySearch.md](HierarchySearch.md)** - Finding class/interface inheritance and implementations
- **[Advanced.md](Advanced.md)** - Power user techniques for complex searches
- **[Troubleshooting.md](Troubleshooting.md)** - What to do when searches return NO-MATCHES or too many results
- **[Implementation.md](Implementation.md)** - Technical details for skill contributors (optional)

## Quick Search Examples

```bash
# Find class declarations
uv run search_game_code.py class declaration CubeGridComponent

# Find method signatures
uv run search_game_code.py method signature OnAddedToScene

# Find class hierarchy
uv run search_game_code.py class children GameComponent

# Count results before viewing (useful for large result sets)
uv run search_game_code.py class usage CubeGridComponent --count

# Limit number of results
uv run search_game_code.py class usage CubeGridComponent --limit 10

# Paginate through results
uv run search_game_code.py class usage CubeGridComponent --limit 10 --offset 0
uv run search_game_code.py class usage CubeGridComponent --limit 10 --offset 20
```

Always check the game code when:
- You're unsure about the game's internal APIs and how to interface with them.
- The inner workings of Space Engineers is unclear.

## Custom Scripting

For building your own utility scripts to work with the indexes and decompiled code:

- **[ScriptingGuide.md](ScriptingGuide.md)** - How to write Python scripts, use BusyBox, handle Windows paths

## Game Content Data

The textual part of the game's `Content` is copied into the `Data/Content` folder for free text search:
- Language translations, including the string IDs
- Block and other entity definitions
- Default blueprints and scenarios
- See [ContentTypes.md](ContentTypes.md) for the full list of content types

### Content Index

`Data/CodeIndex/content_index.csv` maps every textual content file to the decompiled C#
source files that reference it. Columns: `rel_path` (path relative to `Data/Content/`)
and `usage` (path of a C# source file in `Data/Decompiled/` that references it). Each
content file appears once per usage, so you can filter and page by `rel_path` to see
all C# code that loads or references a given content file. Files with no known usages
have a single row with an empty `usage` column.

## General Rules

- In the `Data/Decompiled` folder search only inside the C# source files (*.cs) in general. If you work on transpiler or preloader patches, then also search in the IL code (*.il) files.
- In the `Data/Content` folder search the files appropriate for the task. See [ContentTypes.md](ContentTypes.md) for the list of types.
- Do not search for decompiled game code outside the `Data/Decompiled` folder. The decompiled game source tree must be there if the preparation succeeded.
- Do not search for game content data outside the `Data/Content` folder. The copied game content must be there if the preparation succeeded.
