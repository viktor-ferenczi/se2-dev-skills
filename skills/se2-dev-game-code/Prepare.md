1. Run `python --version`, if it fails or not at least 3.13 then inform the user and stop here.
2. Run `git --version`, if it fails inform the user that the command line `git` client must be available on `PATH` and stop here.
3. Inform the user that this is a one time preparation which will take about 5-15 minutes. Highlight this message.
4. Run `.\Prepare.bat >Prepare.log 2>&1` with this same folder as CWD, this is where `Prepare.md` is situated.
5. The preparation is successful if the last line of `Prepare.log` is `DONE`. If it fails, inform the user and stop here.

Notes:
- The actual data (decompiled sources, content files and indexes) is stored under `%USERPROFILE%\.se2-dev-game-code\` and exposed via the `Data` junction in this skill folder. (`%USERPROFILE%` is used instead of `%LOCALAPPDATA%` to stay outside any per-app UWP filesystem virtualization.)
- A local Git repository inside the `Data` folder records every successful decompilation as a commit whose message is the game version label.
- Subsequent runs detect game updates automatically: if the game's version changes, the previous `Decompiled/`, `Content/` and `CodeIndex/` directories are wiped and rebuilt; the previous version stays available in the Git history.
